Overview                               

    This project uses 3D printing, a temperature and humidity sensor, and solar power 
     to make a birdhouse with a simple weather station attached.

	Instructions                

    Assemble an Adafruit QuadAlpha Feather Wing as described 
        here !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

    Follow the

    The solar panel is connected to the Voltaic bard rechargable battery.  

    Then connect the rechargable battery to the microcontroller.

Software Prerequisites          

    This project requires the Arduino IDE flash the C code to the microcontroller.

Software Walkthrough           

    This project used an Adafruit Huzza Feather for the microcontroller, but any Feather should work since 
    none of the ESP3266 WiFi features are used in this version of the project.

    The code uses the 
    !!!!!!!!BMT11(is this correct?) sensor and corresponding library for 
    temperature and humidity readings.

Usage                                 

	Once the hardare for this project is assembled and the firmware uploaded to the microcontroller,
    the usage is to place mount the solar panel in a sunny spot and place the attached 
    microcontroller and display in a location where they cannot get wet.
    
    Then you can look at the 
    !!!!!!!!TYPE OF DISPLAY
    and observe the temperature and humidity.

Going Further 

    To make take this project go further:

        actually use some of the ESP3266 features

        create/model a 3D printed enclousre for the display an microcontroller
